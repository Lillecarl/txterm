"""
Run esctest2 inside a txterm widget, and compare the result with a
recorded list.

esctest2 judges a terminal from the inside: it runs as a program in that
terminal, writes control sequences and reads the reports that come back.
Nothing in it knows what txterm is.

**This is the proof that the screen layer is really shared.** ptterm
runs the same suite on a bare `Process`, with no toolkit anywhere
(`ptterm/tests/drive_with_esctest.py`). Here the same screen sits inside
a Textual widget, inside a Textual application, on Textual's own event
loop: the suite is a program in a pane, and the pane is drawn by a
second front end. A name that fails here and passes there is txterm's,
and there should be very few of them. Lillecarl/pymux#82.

**A widget answers no resize.** ptterm's host owns its pty and can take
any size the suite asks for. A widget sits in a layout that somebody
else owns, so `Terminal` says no by default, and the suite is not told
that the window operations of xterm are on. That is the whole reason
the two lists differ, and it is the same reason `pymux` has a list of
its own.

Run it:

    nix build --file . checks.txterm-esctest

Narrow it to one class while hunting one failure. A narrowed run is
judged too: a name in the list that the regular expression does not
choose was never going to run, so it does not count as missing.

    TXTERM_ESCTEST_INCLUDE=BSTests nix build --file . checks.txterm-esctest

Every run writes the list it saw and the log that says why, whatever the
verdict, because the run of a check does not fail when the suite fails:

    nix build --file . checks.txterm-esctest.run
    less result/esctest.log
    cp result/failures.txt txterm/tests/esctest-failures.txt

Three variables reach this file from `txterm/nix/checks.nix`:
`TXTERM_ESCTEST` names the directory that holds `esctest.py`, and the
check does nothing when it is not set. `TXTERM_ESCTEST_INCLUDE` is the
regular expression of test names to run. `TXTERM_ESCTEST_OUT` names the
directory to write the list and the log into.
